# Code Journal by Jordan
A collection of beginner-friendly Python scripts and tools designed to reinforce core programming concepts, track progress, and make learning fun.

## Final note from the developer
This repository started as a way to help me retain the basics of programming while I was learning from scratch.
If you're reading this and struggling like i was - don't stop.
You *will* get better. Make it fun, track your progress, and remember:
> **Mastery is built one small session at a time.**
